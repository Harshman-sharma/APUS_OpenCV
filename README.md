# APUS_OpenCV
A basic program to demonstrate how OpenCV and raspberry Pi 3 Model B can be used to built a Self Driving car model.

The code in APUS.py is divided into 3 parts, for 3 different purposes, ie, 
1) Stop sign detection, 
2) Traffic lights detection, 
3) Detecting the lane in which car is moving and keeping the car on track by steering it when needed.

Components needed : 
1) 1 Raspberry Pi (any model)
2) 1 PiCam module
3) 1 Servo
4) 2 Motors
5) 1 car chassis
6) 1 power source
7) Jumper wires

NOTE : In this case, the frontal tyres of car model are not connected to any motors and so the steering module is created by connecting them to a servo which turns a few degrees to steer both wheels in the desired direction.

Code might differ a bit for creators who have incorporated variation in steering mechanism.
