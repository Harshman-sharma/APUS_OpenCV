# APUS_OpenCV
A basic program to demonstrate how OpenCV and raspberry Pi 3 Model B can be used to built a Self Driving car model. The project divides code into 3 parts, for 3 different purposes, ie, 1) Stop sign detection, 2)Traffic lights detection, 3)Detecting the lane in which car is moving and keeping the car on track by steering it when needed.
